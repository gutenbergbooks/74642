  <h3 class='c006'>LITTLE EYOLF.<br> <br> INTRODUCTION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'><i>Little Eyolf</i> was written in Christiania during 1894, and
published in Copenhagen on December 11 in that year.
By this time Ibsen’s correspondence has become so
scanty as to afford us no clue to what may be called
the biographical antecedents of the play. Even of
anecdotic history very little attaches to it. For only
one of the characters has a definite model been suggested.
Ibsen himself told his French translator,
Count Prozor, that the original of the Rat-Wife was
“a little old woman who came to kill rats at the
school where he was educated. She carried a little
dog in a bag, and it was said that children had been
drowned through following her.” This means that
Ibsen did not himself adapt to his uses the legend so
familiar to us in Browning’s <i>Pied Piper of Hamelin</i>,
but found it ready adapted by the popular imagination
of his native place, Skien. “This idea,” Ibsen
continued to Count Prozor, “was just what I wanted
for bringing about the disappearance of Little Eyolf,
in whom the infatuation<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and the feebleness of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>father are reproduced, but concentrated, exaggerated,
as one often sees them in the son of such a father.”
Dr. Elias tells us that a well-known lady-artist,
who in middle life suggested to him the figure of Lona
Hessel, was in later years the model for the Rat-Wife.
There is no inconsistency between these two accounts
of the matter. The idea was doubtless suggested by
his recollection of the rat-catcher of Skien, while traits
of manner and physiognomy might be borrowed
from the lady in question.</p>

<p class='c001'>The verse quoted on pp. 52 and 53 is the last
line of a very well-known poem by Johan Sebastian
Welhaven, entitled <i>Republikanerne</i>, written in
1839. An unknown guest in a Paris restaurant has
been challenged by a noisy party of young Frenchmen
to join them in drinking a health to Poland. He
refuses; they denounce him as a craven and a slave;
he bares his breast and shows the scars of wounds
received in fighting for the country whose lost cause
has become a subject for conventional enthusiasm and
windy rhetoric.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="no">“De saae paa hverandre. Han vandred sin vei.</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="no">De havde champagne, men rörte den ei.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“They looked at each other. He went on his way.
There stood their champagne, but they did not touch
it.” The champagne incident leads me to wonder
whether the relation between Rita and Allmers may
not have been partly suggested to Ibsen by the relation
between Charlotte Stieglitz and her weakling of a
husband. Their story must have been known to him
through George Brandes’s <i>Young Germany</i>, if not
more directly. “From time to time,” says Dr.
Brandes, “there came over her what she calls her
champagne-mood; she grieves that this is no longer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>the case with him.”<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Did the germ of the incident
lie in these words?</p>

<p class='c001'>The first performance of the play in Norway took
place at the Christiania Theatre on January 15, 1895,
Fru Wettergren playing Rita and Fru Dybwad, Asta.
In Copenhagen (March 13, 1895) Fru Oda Nielsen
and Fru Hennings played Rita and Asta respectively,
while Emil Poulsen played Allmers. The first German
Rita (Deutsches Theater, Berlin, January 12,
1895) was Frau Agnes Sorma, with Reicher as Allmers.
Six weeks later Frl. Sandrock played Rita at the
Burgtheater, Vienna. In May 1895 the play was
acted by M. Lugné-Poë’s company in Paris. The
first performance in English took place at the Avenue
Theatre, London, on the afternoon of November 23,
1896, with Miss Janet Achurch as Rita, Miss Elizabeth
Robins as Asta, and Mrs. Patrick Campbell as the Rat-Wife.
Miss Achurch’s Rita made a profound impression.
Mrs. Patrick Campbell afterwards played the
part in a short series of evening performances. In the
spring of 1895 the play was acted in Chicago by a
company of Scandinavian amateurs, presumably in
Norwegian. Fru Oda Nielsen has recently (I understand)
given some performances of it in New York,
and Madame Alla Nazimova has announced it for production
during the coming season (1907-1908).</p>

<p class='c001'>As the external history of <i>Little Eyolf</i> is so short, I
am tempted to depart from my usual practice, and
say a few words as to its matter and meaning.</p>

<p class='c001'>George Brandes, writing of this play, has rightly
observed that “a kind of dualism has always been
perceptible in Ibsen; he pleads the cause of Nature
and he castigates Nature with mystic morality; only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>sometimes Nature is allowed the first voice, sometimes
morality. In <i>The Master Builder</i> and in <i>Ghosts</i> the
lover of Nature in Ibsen was predominant; here, as
in <i>Brand</i> and <i>The Wild Duck</i>, the castigator is in the
ascendant.” So clearly is this the case in <i>Little Eyolf</i>
that Ibsen seems almost to fall into line with Mr.
Thomas Hardy. To say nothing of analogies of
detail between <i>Little Eyolf</i> and <i>Jude the Obscure</i>, there
is this radical analogy, that they are both utterances
of a profound pessimism, both indictments of Nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>But while Mr. Hardy’s pessimism is plaintive and
passive, Ibsen’s is stoical and almost bracing. It is
true that in this play he is no longer the mere “indignation-pessimist”
whom Dr. Brandes quite justly
recognised in his earlier works. His analysis has
gone deeper into the heart of things, and he has put
off the satirist and the iconoclast. But there is in his
thought an incompressible energy of revolt. A pessimist
in contemplation, he remains a meliorist in
action. He is not, like Mr. Hardy, content to let the
flag droop half-mast high; his protagonist still runs it
up to the mast-head, and looks forward steadily to the
“heavy day of work” before him. But although the
note of the conclusion is resolute, almost serene, the
play remains none the less an indictment of Nature,
or at least of that egoism of passion which is one of
her most potent subtleties. In this view, Allmers
becomes a type of what we may roughly call the “free
moral agent”; Eyolf, a type of humanity conceived as
passive and suffering, thrust will-less into existence,
with boundless aspirations and cruelly limited powers;
Rita, a type of the egoistic instinct which is “a consuming
fire”; and Asta, a type of the beneficent love
which is possible only so long as it is exempt from
“the law of change.” Allmers, then, is self-conscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>egoism, egoism which can now and then break its
chains, look in its own visage, realise and shrink from
itself; while Rita, until she has passed through the
awful crisis which forms the matter of the play, is unconscious,
reckless, and ruthless egoism, exigent and
jealous, “holding to its rights,” and incapable even of
rising into the secondary stage of maternal love. The
offspring and the victim of these egoisms is Eyolf,
“little wounded warrior,” who longs to scale the
heights and dive into the depths, but must remain
for ever chained to the crutch of human infirmity.
For years Allmers has been a restless and half-reluctant
slave to Rita’s imperious temperament. He
has dreamed and theorised about “responsibility,”
and has kept Eyolf poring over his books, in the hope
that, despite his misfortune, he may one day minister
to parental vanity. Finally he breaks away from
Rita, for the first time “in all these ten years,” goes
up “into the infinite solitudes,” looks Death in the
face, and returns shrinking from passion, yearning
towards selfless love, and filled with a profound and
remorseful pity for the lot of poor maimed humanity.
He will “help Eyolf to bring his desires into harmony
with what lies attainable before him.” He will
“create a conscious happiness in his mind.” And
here the drama opens.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before the Rat-Wife enters, let me pause for a
moment to point out that here again Ibsen adopts
that characteristic method which, in writing of <i>The
Lady from the Sea</i> and <i>The Master Builder</i>, I have
compared to the method of Hawthorne. The story he
tells is not really, or rather not inevitably, supernatural.
Everything is explicable within the limits
of nature; but supernatural agency is also vaguely
suggested, and the reader’s imagination is stimulated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>without any absolute violence to his sense of reality.
On the plane of everyday life, then, the Rat-Wife is
a crazy and uncanny old woman, fabled by the peasants
to be a were-wolf in her leisure moments, who goes
about the country killing vermin. Coming across an
impressionable child, she tells him a preposterous tale,
adapted from the old “Pied Piper” legends, of her
method of fascinating her victims. The child, whose
imagination has long dwelt on this personage, is in fact
hypnotised by her, follows her down to the sea, and,
watching her row away, turns dizzy, falls in, and is
drowned. There is nothing impossible, nothing even
improbable, in this. At the same time, there cannot
be the least doubt, I think, that in the poet’s mind
the Rat-Wife is the symbol of Death, of the “still,
soft darkness” that is at once so fearful and so
fascinating to humanity. This is clear not only in the
text of her single scene, but in the fact that Allmers,
in the last act, treats her and his “fellow-traveller”
of that night among the mountains, not precisely as
identical, but as interchangeable, ideas. To tell the
truth, I have even my own suspicions as to who is
meant by “her sweetheart,” whom she “lured” long
ago, and who is now “down where all the rats are.”
This theory I shall keep to myself; it may be purely
fantastic, and is at best inessential. What is certain
is that death carries off Little Eyolf, and that, of all
he was, only the crutch is left, mute witness to his
hapless lot.</p>

<p class='c001'>He is gone; there was so little to bind him to life
that he made not even a moment’s struggle against
the allurement of the “long, sweet sleep.” Then, for
the first time, the depth of the egoism which had
created and conditioned his little life bursts upon his
parents’ horror-stricken gaze. Like accomplices in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>crime, they turn upon and accuse each other—“sorrow
makes them wicked and hateful.” Allmers, as the
one whose eyes were already half opened, is the first
to carry war into the enemy’s country; but Rita is
not slow to retort, and presently they both have to
admit that their recriminations are only a vain attempt
to drown the voice of self-reproach. In a sort of
fierce frenzy they tear away veil after veil from their
souls, until they realise that Eyolf never existed at all,
so to speak, for his own sake, but only for the sake of
their passions and vanities. “Isn’t it curious,” says
Rita, summing up the matter, “that we should grieve
like this over a little stranger boy?”</p>

<p class='c001'>In blind self-absorption they have played with life
and death, and now “the great open eyes” of the
stranger boy will be for ever upon them. Allmers
would fain take refuge in a love untainted by the
egoism, and unexposed to the revulsions, of <a id='corrxiii.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='passion'>passion.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_xiii.18'><ins class='correction' title='passion'>passion.</ins></a></span>
But not only is Asta’s pity for Rita too strong to let
her countenance this desertion: she has discovered
that her relation to Allmers is <i>not</i> “exempt from the
law of change,” and she “takes flight from him—and
from herself.” Meanwhile it appears that the agony
which Allmers and Rita have endured in probing their
wounds has been, as Halvard Solness would say,
“salutary self-torture.” The consuming fire of passion
is now quenched, but “it has left an empty place
within them,” and they feel a common need “to fill
it up with something that is a little like love.” They
come to remember that there are other children in
the world on whom reckless instinct has thrust the
gift of life—neglected children, stunted and maimed
in mind if not in body. And now that her egoism is
seared to the quick, the mother-instinct asserts itself
in Rita. She will take these children to her—these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>children to whom her hand and her heart have hitherto
been closed. They shall be outwardly in Eyolf’s
place, and perhaps in time they may fill the place in
her heart that should have been Eyolf’s. Thus she
will try to “make her peace with the great open eyes.”
For now, at last, she has divined the secret of the
unwritten book on “human responsibility,” and has
realised that motherhood means—atonement.</p>

<p class='c001'>So I read this terrible and beautiful work of art.
This, I think, is <i>a</i> meaning inherent in it—not perhaps
<i>the</i> meaning, and still less all the meanings. Indeed,
its peculiar fascination for me, among all Ibsen’s
works, lies in the fact that it seems to touch life at so
many different points. But I must not be understood
as implying that Ibsen constructed the play with any
such definitely allegoric design as is here set forth. I
do not believe that this creator of men and women
ever started from an abstract conception. He did
not first compose his philosophic tune and then set
his puppets dancing to it. The germ in his mind was
dramatic, not ethical; it was only as the drama developed
that its meanings dawned upon him; and he
left them implicit and fragmentary, like the symbolism
of life itself, seldom formulated, never worked out
with schematic precision. He simply took a cutting
from the tree of life, and, planting it in the rich soil
of his imagination, let it ramify and burgeon as it
would.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even if one did not know the date of <i>Little Eyolf</i>,
one could confidently assign it to the latest period of
Ibsen’s career, on noting a certain difference of scale
between its foundations and its superstructure. In
his earlier plays, down to and including <i>Hedda Gabler</i>,
we feel his invention at work to the very last moment,
often with more intensity in the last act than in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>first, in his later plays he seems to be in haste to pass
as early as possible from invention to pure analysis.
In this play, after the death of Eyolf (surely one of
the most inspired “situations” in all drama) there is
practically no external action whatsoever. Nothing
happens save in the souls of the characters; there is
no further invention, but rather what one may perhaps
call inquisition. This does not prevent the second
act from being quite the most poignant or the third
act from being one of the most moving that Ibsen ever
wrote. Far from wishing to depreciate the play, I
rate it more highly, perhaps, than most critics—among
the very greatest of Ibsen’s achievements. I merely
note as a characteristic of the poet’s latest manner
this disparity of scale between the work foreshadowed,
so to speak, and the work completed. We shall find
it still more evident in the case of <i>John Gabriel
Borkman</i>.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>
  <h3 class='c006'>JOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN. <br> <br> INTRODUCTION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The anecdotic history of <i>John Gabriel Borkman</i> is
even scantier than that of <i>Little Eyolf</i>. It is true
that two mentions of it occur in Ibsen’s letters, but
they throw no light whatever upon its spiritual antecedents.
Writing to George Brandes from Christiania,
on April 24, 1896, Ibsen says: "In your last letter
you make the suggestion that I should visit London.
If I knew enough English, I might perhaps go. But
as I unfortunately do not, I must give up the idea
altogether. Besides, I am engaged in preparing for
a big new work, and I do not wish to put off the
writing of it longer than necessary. It might so
easily happen that a roof-tile fell on my head before
I had ‘found time to make the last verse.’ And
what then?" On October 3 of the same year, writing
to the same correspondent, he again alludes to his
work at “a new long play, which must be completed
as soon as possible.” It was, as a matter of fact,
completed with very little delay, for it appeared in
Copenhagen on December 15, 1896.</p>

<p class='c001'>The irresponsible gossip of the time made out that
Björnson discerned in the play some personal allusions
to himself; but this Björnson emphatically denied.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>I am not aware that any attempt has been made to
identify the originals of the various characters. It
need scarcely be pointed out that in the sisters
Gunhild and Ella we have the pair of women, one
strong and masterful, the other tender and devoted,
who run through so many of Ibsen’s plays, from <i>The
Feast at Solhoug</i> onwards—nay, even from <i>Catilina</i>.
In my Introduction to <i>The Lady from the Sea</i> (p. xxii)
it is pointed out that Ibsen had the character of
Foldal clearly in his mind when, in March 1880, he
made the first draft of that play. The character there
appears as: "The old married clerk. Has written a play
in his youth which was only once acted. Is for ever
touching it up, and lives in the illusion that it will be
published and will make a great success. Takes no
steps, however, to bring this about. Nevertheless
accounts himself one of the ‘literary’ class. His wife
and children believe blindly in the play." By the
time Foldal actually came to life, the faith of his wife
and children had sadly dwindled away.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was scarcely a theatre in Scandinavia or
Finland at which <i>John Gabriel Borkman</i> was not acted
in the course of January 1897. Helsingfors led the
way with performances both at the Swedish and
at the Finnish Theatres on January 10. Christiania
and Stockholm followed on January 25, Copenhagen
on January 31; and meanwhile the piece had been
presented at many provincial theatres as well. In
Christiania, Borkman, Gunhild, and Ella were played
by Garmann, Fru Gundersen, and Fröken Reimers
respectively; in Copenhagen, by Emil Poulsen, Fru
Eckhardt, and Fru Hennings. In the course of 1897
it spread all over Germany, beginning with Frankfort
on Main, where, oddly enough, it was somewhat maltreated
by the Censorship. In London, an organisation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>calling itself the New Century Theatre presented
<i>John Gabriel Borkman</i> at the Strand Theatre on the
afternoon of May 3, 1897, with Mr. W. H. Vernon as
Borkman, Miss Geneviève Ward as Gunhild, Miss
Elizabeth Robins as Ella Rentheim, Mr. Martin
Harvey as Erhart, Mr. James Welch as Foldal, and
Mrs. Beerbohm Tree as Mrs. Wilton. The first
performance in America was given by the Criterion
Independent Theatre of New York on November 18,
1897, Mr. E. J. Henley playing Borkman, Mr. John
Blair Erhart, Miss Maude Banks Gunhild, and Miss
Ann Warrington Ella. For some reason, which I can
only conjecture to be the weakness of the third act,
the play seems nowhere to have taken a very firm
hold on the stage.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Brahm has drawn attention to the great similarity
between the theme of <i>John Gabriel Borkman</i>
and that of <i>Pillars of Society</i>. “In both,” he says,
“we have a business man of great ability who is guilty
of a crime; in both this man is placed between two
sisters; and in both he renounces a marriage of inclination
for the sake of a marriage that shall further
his business interests.” The likeness is undeniable;
and yet how utterly unlike are the two plays! and
how immeasurably superior the later one! It may
seem, on a superficial view, that in <i>John Gabriel
Borkman</i> Ibsen has returned to prose and the common
earth after his excursion into poetry and the possibly
supernatural, if I may so call it, in <i>The Master Builder</i>
and <i>Little Eyolf</i>. But this is a very superficial view
indeed. We have only to compare the whole invention
of <i>John Gabriel Borkman</i> with the invention of <i>Pillars
of Society</i>, to realise the difference between the poetry
and the prose of drama. The quality of imagination
which conceived the story of the House of Bernick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>is utterly unlike that which conceived the tragedy of
the House of Borkman. The difference is not greater
between (say) <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> and <i>King Lear</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The technical feat which Ibsen here achieves of
carrying through without a single break the whole
action of a four-act play has been much commented
on and admired. The imaginary time of the drama
is actually shorter than the real time of representation,
since the poet does not even leave intervals
for the changing of the scenes. This feat, however,
is more curious than important. Nothing particular
is gained by such a literal observance of the
unity of time. For the rest, we feel definitely in
<i>John Gabriel Borkman</i> what we already felt vaguely in
<i>Little Eyolf</i>—that the poet’s technical staying-power
is beginning to fail him. We feel that the initial
design was larger and more detailed than the finished
work. If the last acts of <i>The Wild Duck</i> and <i>Hedda
Gabler</i> be compared with the last acts of <i>Little Eyolf</i>
and <i>Borkman</i>, it will be seen that in the earlier plays
his constructive faculty is working at its highest
tension up to the very end, while in the later plays
it relaxes towards the close, to make room for pure
imagination and lyric beauty. The actual drama is
over long before the curtain falls on either play, and
in the one case we have Rita and Allmers, in the other
Ella and Borkman, looking back over their shattered
lives and playing chorus to their own tragedy. For
my part, I set the highest value on these choral odes,
these mournful antiphonies, in which the poet definitely
triumphs over the mere playwright. They seem
to me noble and beautiful in themselves, and as truly
artistic, if not as theatrical, as any abrupter catastrophe
could be. But I am not quite sure that they
are exactly the conclusions the poet originally projected,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>and still less am I satisfied that they are
reached by precisely the paths which he at first
designed to pursue.</p>

<p class='c001'>The traces of a change of scheme in <i>John Gabriel
Borkman</i> seem to me almost unmistakable. The
first two acts laid the foundation for a larger and
more complex superstructure than is ultimately
erected. Ibsen seems to have designed that Hinkel,
the man who “betrayed” Borkman in the past, should
play some efficient part in the alienation of Erhart
from his family and home. Otherwise, why this
insistence on a “party” at the Hinkels’, which is
apparently to serve as a sort of “send-off” for Erhart
and Mrs. Wilton? It appears in the third act that the
“party” was imaginary. “Erhart and I were the
whole party,” says Mrs. Wilton, “and little Frida, of
course.” We might, then, suppose it to have been a
mere blind to enable Erhart to escape from home;
but, in the first place, as Erhart does not live at home,
there is no need for any such pretext; in the second
place, it appears that the trio do actually go to the
Hinkels’ house (since Mrs. Borkman’s servant finds
them there), and do actually make it their starting-point.
Erhart comes and goes with the utmost freedom
in Mrs. Wilton’s own house; what possible
reason can they have for not setting out from there?
No reason is shown or hinted. We cannot even
imagine that the Hinkels have been instrumental in
bringing Erhart and Mrs. Wilton together; it is expressly
stated that Erhart made her acquaintance and
saw a great deal of her in town, before she moved out
into the country. The whole conception of the party
at the Hinkels’ is, as it stands, mysterious and a little
cumbersome. We are forced to conclude, I think,
that something more was at one time intended to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>come of it, and that, when the poet abandoned the idea,
he did not think it worth while to remove the scaffolding.
To this change of plan, too, we may possibly
trace what I take to be the one serious flaw in the
play—the comparative weakness of the second half
of the third act. The scene of Erhart’s rebellion
against the claims of mother, aunt, and father strikes
one as the symmetrical working out of a problem
rather than a passage of living drama.</p>

<p class='c001'>All this means, of course, that there is a certain
looseness of fibre in <i>John Gabriel Borkman</i> which we do
not find in the best of Ibsen’s earlier works. But in
point of intellectual power and poetic beauty it yields
to none of its predecessors. The conception of the
three leading figures is one of the great things of
literature; the second act, with the exquisite humour
of the Foldal scene, and the dramatic intensity of the
encounter between Borkman and Ella, is perhaps the
finest single act Ibsen ever wrote, in prose at all
events; and the last scene is a thing of rare and
exalted beauty. One could wish that the poet’s last
words to us had been those haunting lines with which
Gunhild and Ella join hands over Borkman’s body:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>We twin sisters—over him we have both loved.</div>
      <div class='line'>We two shadows—over the dead man.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Among many verbal difficulties which this play
presents, the greatest, perhaps, has been to find an
equivalent for the word “opreisning,” which occurs
again and again in the first and second acts. No one
English word that I could discover would fit in all the
different contexts; so I have had to employ three:
“redemption,” “restoration,” and in one place “rehabilitation.”
The reader may bear in mind that these
three terms represent one idea in the original.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>Borkman in Act II. uses a very odd expression—“overskurkens
moral,” which I have rendered “the
morals of the higher rascality.” I cannot but suspect
(though for this I have no authority) that in the word
“overskurk,” which might be represented in German
by “Ueberschurke,” Borkman is parodying the expression
“Uebermensch,” of which so much has been
heard of late. When I once suggested this to Ibsen,
he neither affirmed nor denied it. I understood him
to say, however, that in speaking of “overskurken”
he had a particular man in view. Somewhat pusillanimously,
perhaps, I pursued my inquiries no further.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>WHEN WE DEAD AWAKEN.<br> <br> INTRODUCTION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>From <i>Pillars of Society</i> to <i>John Gabriel Borkman</i>,
Ibsen’s plays had followed each other at regular
intervals of two years, save when his indignation over
the abuse heaped upon <i>Ghosts</i> reduced to a single
year the interval between that play and <i>An Enemy of
the People</i>. <i>John Gabriel Borkman</i> having appeared
in 1896, its successor was expected in 1898; but
Christmas came and brought no rumour of a new play.
In a man now over seventy, this breach of a long-established
habit seemed ominous. The new National
Theatre in Christiania was opened in September of
the following year; and when I then met Ibsen (for
the last time) he told me that he was actually at work
on a new play, which he thought of calling a “Dramatic
Epilogue.” “He wrote <i>When We Dead Awaken</i>,” says
Dr. Elias, “with such labour and such passionate agitation,
so spasmodically and so feverishly, that those
around him were almost alarmed. He must get on
with it, he must get on! He seemed to hear the beating
of dark pinions over his head. He seemed to feel the
grim Visitant, who had accompanied Alfred Allmers
on the mountain paths, already standing behind him
with uplifted hand. His relatives are firmly convinced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>that he knew quite clearly that this would be
his last play, that he was to write no more. And soon
the blow fell.”</p>

<p class='c001'><i>When We Dead Awaken</i> was published very shortly
before Christmas 1899. He had still a year of comparative
health before him. We find him, in March 1900,
writing to Count Prozor: “I cannot say yet whether or
not I shall write another drama; but if I continue to retain
the vigour of body and mind which I at present enjoy,
I do not imagine that I shall be able to keep permanently
away from the old battlefields. However, if
I were to make my appearance again, it would be with
new weapons and in new armour.” Was he hinting
at the desire, which he had long ago confessed to
Professor Herford, that his last work should be a
drama in verse? Whatever his dream, it was not to
be realised. His last letter (defending his attitude of
philosophic impartiality with regard to the South
African War) is dated December 9, 1900. With the
dawn of the new century, the curtain descended upon
the mind of the great dramatic poet of the age which
had passed away.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>When We Dead Awaken</i> was acted during 1900 at
most of the leading theatres in Scandinavia and Germany.
In some German cities (notably in Frankfort
on Main) it even attained a considerable number of
representations. I cannot learn, however, that it has
anywhere held the stage. It was produced in London,
by the Stage Society, at the Imperial Theatre, on
January 25 and 26, 1903. Mr. G. S. Titheradge
played Rubek, Miss Henrietta Watson Irene, Miss
Mabel Hackney Maia, and Mr. Laurence Irving
Ulfheim. I find no record of any American performance.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the above-mentioned letter to Count Prozor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>Ibsen confirmed that critic’s conjecture that “the
series which ends with the Epilogue really began with
<i>The Master Builder</i>.” As the last confession, so to
speak, of a great artist, the Epilogue will always be read
with interest. It contains, moreover, many flashes of
the old genius, many strokes of the old incommunicable
magic. One may say with perfect sincerity that
there is more fascination in the dregs of Ibsen’s mind
than in the “first sprightly running” of more commonplace
talents. But to his sane admirers the interest
of the play must always be melancholy, because it is
purely pathological. To deny this is, in my opinion,
to cast a slur over all the poet’s previous work, and
in great measure to justify the criticisms of his
most violent detractors. For <i>When We Dead Awaken</i>
is very like the sort of play that haunted the “anti-Ibsenite”
imagination in the year 1893 or thereabouts.
It is a piece of self-caricature, a series of echoes from
all the earlier plays, an exaggeration of manner to
the pitch of mannerism. Moreover, in his treatment
of his symbolic motives, Ibsen did exactly what he
had hitherto, with perfect justice, plumed himself
upon never doing: he sacrificed the surface reality to
the underlying meaning. Take, for instance, the
history of Rubek’s statue and its development into
a group. In actual sculpture this development is
a grotesque impossibility. In conceiving it we are
deserting the domain of reality, and plunging into
some fourth dimension where the properties of matter
are other than those we know. This is an abandonment
of the fundamental principle which Ibsen over
and over again emphatically expressed—namely, that
any symbolism his work might be found to contain
was entirely incidental, and subordinate to the truth
and consistency of his picture of life. Even when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>he dallied with the supernatural, as in <i>The Master
Builder</i> and <i>Little Eyolf</i>, he was always careful, as
I have tried to show, not to overstep decisively
the boundaries of the natural. Here, on the other
hand, without any suggestion of the supernatural,
we are confronted with the wholly impossible, the
inconceivable. How remote is this alike from his
principles of art and from the consistent, unvarying
practice of his better years! So great is the chasm
between <i>John Gabriel Borkman</i> and <i>When We Dead
Awaken</i> that one could almost suppose his mental
breakdown to have preceded instead of followed the
writing of the latter play. Certainly it is one of the
premonitions of the coming end. It is Ibsen’s <i>Count
Robert of Paris</i>. To pretend to rank it with his
masterpieces is to show a very imperfect sense of the
nature of their mastery.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>ACT FIRST</h3>

<p class='c017'><i>A pretty and richly-decorated garden-room, full
of furniture, flowers, and plants. At the
back, open glass doors, leading out to a
verandah. An extensive view over the fiord.
In the distance, wooded hillsides. A door
in each of the side walls, the one on the
right a folding door, placed far back. In
front on the right, a sofa, with cushions
and rugs. Beside the sofa, a small table,
and chairs. In front, on the left, a larger
table, with arm-chairs around it. On the
table stands an open hand-bag. It is an
early summer morning, with warm sunshine.</i></p>

<p class='c018'><i><span class='sc'>Mrs. Rita Allmers</span> stands beside the table,
facing towards the left, engaged in unpacking
the bag. She is a handsome, rather
tall, well-developed blonde, about thirty
years of age, dressed in a light-coloured
morning-gown.</i></p>

<p class='c018'><i>Shortly after, <span class='sc'>Miss Asta Allmers</span> enters by the
door on the right, wearing a light brown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>summer dress, with hat, jacket, and parasol.
Under her arm she carries a locked
portfolio of considerable size. She is slim,
of middle height, with dark hair, and deep,
earnest eyes. Twenty-five years old.</i></p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>As she enters.</i>] Good-morning, my dear
Rita.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Turns her head, and nods to her.</i>] What!
is that you, Asta? Come all the way from town
so early?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Takes off her things, and lays them on a
chair beside the door.</i>] Yes, such a restless
feeling came over me. I felt I <em class='gesperrt'>must</em> come out
to-day, and see how little Eyolf was getting on—and
you too. [<i>Lays the portfolio on the
table beside the sofa.</i>] So I took the steamer,
and here I am.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Smiling to her.</i>] And I daresay you met
one or other of your friends on board? Quite
by chance, of course.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Quietly.</i>] No, I did not meet a soul I
knew. [<i>Sees the bag.</i>] Why, Rita, what have
you got there?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Still unpacking.</i>] Alfred’s travelling-bag.

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Joyfully, approaching her.</i>] What! Has
Alfred come home?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, only think—he came quite unexpectedly
by the late train last night.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, then <em class='gesperrt'>that</em> was what my feeling meant!
It was that that drew me out here! And he
hadn’t written a line to let you know? Not
even a post-card?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not a single word.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Did he not even telegraph?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, an hour before he arrived—quite curtly
and coldly. [<i>Laughs.</i>] Don’t you think that
was like him, Asta?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; he goes so quietly about everything.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But that made it all the more delightful to
have him again.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I am sure it would.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>A whole fortnight before I expected him!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And is he quite well? Not in low spirits?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Closes the bag with a snap, and smiles at
her.</i>] He looked quite transfigured as he stood
in the doorway.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And was he not the least bit tired either?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, yes, he seemed to be tired enough—very
tired, in fact. But, poor fellow, he had come
on foot the greater part of the way.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And then perhaps the high mountain air may
have been rather too keen for him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, no; I don’t think so at all. I haven’t
heard him cough once.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ah, there you see now! It was a good thing,
after all, that the doctor talked him into taking
this tour.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, now that it is safely over.—But I can
tell you it has been a terrible time for me, Asta.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>I have never cared to talk about it—and you so
seldom came out to see me, too——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I daresay that wasn’t very nice of me—but——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, well, well, of course you had your
school to attend to in town. [<i>Smiling.</i>] And
then our road-maker friend—of course he was
away too.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, don’t talk like that, Rita.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Very well, then; we will leave the road-maker
out of the question.—You can’t think how I
have been longing for Alfred! How empty the
place seemed! How desolate! Ugh, it felt as
if there had been a funeral in the house!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, dear me, only six or seven weeks——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; but you must remember that Alfred has
never been away from me before—never so much
as twenty-four hours. Not once in all these ten
years.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No; but that is just why I really think it
was high time he should have a little outing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>this year. He ought to have gone for a tramp
in the mountains every summer—he really
ought.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Half smiling.</i>] Oh yes, it’s all very well
for you to talk. If I were as—as reasonable
as you, I suppose I should have let him go before—perhaps.
But I positively could not,
Asta! It seemed to me I should never get him
back again. Surely you can understand <em class='gesperrt'>that</em>?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No. But I daresay that is because I have
no one to lose.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>With a teasing smile.</i>] Really? No one at
all?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not that <i>I</i> know of. [<i>Changing the subject.</i>]
But tell me, Rita, where is Alfred? Is he still
asleep?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, not at all. He got up as early as ever
to-day.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then he can’t have been so very tired after
all.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, he was last night—when he arrived. But
now he has had little Eyolf with him in his
room for a whole hour and more.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Poor little white-faced boy! Has he to be
for ever at his lessons again?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>With a slight shrug.</i>] Alfred will have it
so, you know.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; but I think you ought to put down your
foot about it, Rita.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Somewhat impatiently.</i>] Oh no; come now,
I really cannot meddle with that. Alfred knows
so much better about these things than I do.
And what would you have Eyolf do? He can’t
run about and play, you see—like other children.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Asta.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>With decision.</i>] I will talk to Alfred about
this.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rita.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, do; I wish you would.—Oh! here he is.</p>

<p class='c019'>[<i><span class='sc'>Alfred Allmers</span>, dressed in light summer
clothes, enters by the door on the

eyes, and thin brown hair and beard.
His expression is serious and thoughtful.
<span class='sc'>Eyolf</span> wears a suit cut like a
uniform, with gold braid and gilt military
buttons. He is lame, and walks

<p class='c001'>[<i>Vehemently.</i>] Ah? Perhaps you can unravel

[<i>More gently.</i>] Here is Eyolf, just entering
upon conscious life: full of such infinite possibilities—splendid
possibilities perhaps: he would
have filled my life with pride and gladness.
And then a crazy old woman has only to come
this way—and show a cur in a bag——</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, we do. The boys saw her row out over
the fiord. They saw Eyolf standing alone at the
very end of the pier. They saw him gazing
after her—and then he seemed to turn giddy.

disappeared.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, that is just the question! Why should
she? There is no retribution behind it all—no
atonement, I mean. Eyolf never did her any
harm. He never called names after her; he
never threw stones at her dog. Why, he had
never set eyes either on her or her dog till yesterday.
So there is no retribution; the whole

Asta.—And yet the order of the world requires
it.</p>

I have never known pity, since you deserted

and crying, and begging for a morsel of food,
I let the servants look to it. I never felt any
desire to take the child to myself, to warm it
at my own hearth, to have the pleasure of seeing
it eat and be satisfied. And yet I was not
like that when I was young; that I remember
clearly! It is you that have created an empty,
barren desert within me—and without me too!</p>

I have had still more ample time. I have
re-tried the whole case—by myself. Time after
time I have re-tried it. I have been my own accuser,
my own defender, and my own judge. I
have been more impartial than any one else could
be—that I venture to say. I have paced up and
down the gallery there, turning every one of my
actions upside down and inside out. I have examined
them from all sides as unsparingly, as
pitilessly, as any lawyer of them all. And the
final judgment I have always come to is this:
the one person I have sinned against is—myself.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, now you shall hear! Only think, when
I got home this evening after I had been with

who it was from?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Borkman.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Possibly from your little Frida?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Foldal.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Precisely! Think of your hitting on it at
once! Yes, it was a long—a pretty long letter
from Frida. A footman had brought it. And
can you imagine what was in it?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Borkman.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps it was to say good-bye to her mother

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Foldal.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Exactly! How good you are at guessing,
John Gabriel! Yes, she tells me that Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Wilton has taken such a fancy to her, and she
is to go abroad with her and study music. And
Mrs. Wilton has engaged a first-rate teacher who
is to accompany them on the journey—and to
read with Frida too. For unfortunately she has
been a good deal neglected in some branches,
you see.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Shaken with inward laughter.</i>] Of course,

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Foldal.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Eagerly continuing.</i>] And only think, she
knew nothing about the arrangement until this
evening; at that party, you know, h’m! And
yet she found time to write to me. And the
letter is such a beautiful one—so warm and
affectionate, I assure you. There is not a trace
of contempt for her father in it. And then what
a delicate thought it was to say good-bye to us
by letter—before she started. [<i>Laughing.</i>] But
of course I can’t let her go like that.</p>

is going forth into the great wide world, that I
once yearned so passionately to see. Little Frida

And at every station I could make out that there
were two railway men walking up and down

they said things to each other in the night,

her arms crossed upon her breast. She

<p class='c001'>[<i>More unfeelingly.</i>] Something of the sort,
to tell the truth, little Maia. For a year or a
year and a half I had lived there lonely and
brooding, and had put the last touch—the very
last touch, to my work. “The Resurrection
Day” went out over the world and brought me
fame—and everything else that heart could
desire. [<i>With greater warmth.</i>] But I no
longer loved my own work. Men’s laurels and
incense nauseated me, till I could have rushed
away in despair and hidden myself in the depths
of the woods. [<i>Looking at her.</i>] You, who
are a thought-reader—can you guess what then
occurred to me?</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Nods.</i>] To order, yes. With animals’ faces

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Again serious.</i>] It was <em class='gesperrt'>this</em>, that all the

at bottom.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are quite a few instances of missing punctuation. The
conventional period following the character’s name is sometimes
missing and has been added for consistency’s sake without
further comment. Those missing from setting and stage direction
are also added without comment, since there is no obvious purpose to be
served by the omission. However, the restoration of punctuation
missing from dialogue is noted below, since the punctuation can be
expressive. One instances of dubious ‘?’ mark has
been corrected to‘!’, based on context.</p>

<p class='c001'>Other errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.</p>
